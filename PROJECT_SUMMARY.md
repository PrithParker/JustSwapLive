## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### **Backend**
- **Flask 3.0.0** - Modern Python web framework
- **OpenCV 4.10.0** - Computer vision and face processing
- **NumPy 1.26.4** - Numerical computations
- **Pillow 11.1.0** - Image processing library
- **Flask-CORS 4.0.0** - Cross-origin resource sharing

### **Frontend**
- **HTML5** with semantic markup
- **CSS3** with modern features (Grid, Flexbox, Backdrop-filter)
- **Vanilla JavaScript ES6+** for optimal performance
- **WebRTC API** for camera access
- **Canvas API** for real-time image processing

## 🎮 How to Use

### **Quick Start**
1. **Activate virtual environment**: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. **Run the application**: `python start_web.py`
3. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
4. **Upload source face**: Drag & drop or click to select image
5. **Start camera**: Click "Start Camera" button
6. **Begin processing**: Click "Start Processing" for live face swap

### **Step-by-Step Usage**
1. **Upload Source Image**: Choose a clear photo with a visible face
2. **Camera Setup**: Allow browser access to your camera
3. **Face Processing**: The system will detect and swap faces in real-time
4. **Monitor Performance**: Watch the FPS counter for performance metrics
5. **Control Processing**: Start/stop processing as needed
